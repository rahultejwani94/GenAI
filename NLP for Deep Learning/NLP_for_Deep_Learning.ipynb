    "# What is CNN and What Do We Use It For?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is CNN?\n",
    "CNN (**Convolutional Neural Network**) is a special type of **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** mainly designed for **image and video data**.  \n",
    "Instead of looking at raw pixels directly, CNN automatically learns to detect **patterns like edges, textures, shapes, and objects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How CNN Works (Steps)\n",
    "1. **Input Image** ‚Üí Raw pixel values (e.g., 28√ó28 image).  \n",
    "2. **Convolution Layer** ‚Üí Applies filters (small sliding windows) to detect edges, lines, curves.  \n",
    "3. **Activation Function (ReLU)** ‚Üí Keeps only useful signals (non-linear patterns).  \n",
    "4. **Pooling Layer** ‚Üí Reduces image size while keeping key features (e.g., Max Pooling).  \n",
    "5. **Flattening** ‚Üí Converts 2D features into a 1D vector.  \n",
    "6. **Fully Connected (Dense) Layer** ‚Üí Works like a normal ANN to combine features.  \n",
    "7. **Output Layer** ‚Üí Gives final prediction (e.g., Cat vs Dog).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flow:** Image ‚Üí Convolution ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí Pooling ‚Üí Flatten ‚Üí Dense ‚Üí Output\n",
