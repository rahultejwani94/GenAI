    "- **TensorFlow** is an **open-source deep learning framework** developed by Google.  \n",
    "- It is used for building and training **machine learning and deep neural networks**.  \n",
    "- Supports both **low-level operations** (tensors, gradients) and **high-level APIs**.  \n",
    "- Works well for large-scale projects and production deployment.  \n",

    "## Keras\n",
    "- **Keras** is a **high-level deep learning API** built on top of TensorFlow.  \n",
    "- It makes creating and training neural networks much **simpler and user-friendly**.  \n",
    "- Provides ready-to-use modules like:\n",
    "  - `Sequential` model for layer stacking  \n",
    "  - Predefined layers (Dense, Conv2D, LSTM, etc.)  \n",
    "  - Optimizers, losses, and metrics  \n",
    "- Recommended for beginners as well as rapid prototyping.  \n",
    "\n",
